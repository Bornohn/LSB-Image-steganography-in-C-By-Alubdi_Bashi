# LSB-Image-steganography-in-C-By-Alubdi_Bashi
‚ÄçThis code was made by Alubdi_Bashi ...LSB-Steganography is a steganography technique in which we hide messages inside an image by replacing Least significant bit of image with the bits of message to be hidden.
This project is a fun and simple way to hide and encrypt secret messages within BMP images. Developed by the fantastic team of Alubdi Bashi and the gang, this tool ensures your secrets are hidden within the pixels of a BMP file.
